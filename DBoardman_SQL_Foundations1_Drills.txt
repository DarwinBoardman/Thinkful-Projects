1. How many records are in the vehicles table?
1A. 33442
1Code. SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles;

2. Write a query that returns all the records in the vehicles table.
2Code. SELECT *
FROM vehicles;

3. Write a query that returns the id, make, and model fields for all the records for 2010 vehicles.
3Code. SELECT id, make, model
FROM vehicles
WHERE year = 2010;

4. Write a query that returns the count of vehicles from 2010. Also provide the answer.
4A. 1109
4Code. SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles
WHERE year = 2010

5. Write a query that returns the count of vehicles in the vehicles table between the years 2010 and 2015, inclusive. Provide the query as well as the answer.
5A. 5995
5Code. SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles
WHERE year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015;

6. Write a query that returns the count of vehicles from the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. Provide the query and the result.
6A. 3026
6Code. SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles
WHERE year IN(1990, 2000, 2010);

7. Write a query that returns the count of all records between 1987 and 2005, exclusive of the years 1990 and 2000.
7A. 17235
7Code. SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles
WHERE year BETWEEN 1987 AND 2005
AND year NOT IN(1990, 2000);

8. Write a query that returns the year, make, model, and a field called average_mpg that calculates the average highway/city fuel consumption. (For example, if hwy is 24 and cty is 20, then average_mpg = (24 + 20)/ 2 = 22.)
8Code. SELECT year, make, model, (hwy + cty)/2 AS average_mpg
FROM vehicles;

9. Write a query that returns the year, make, model, and a text field displaying “X highway; Y city.” (For example, if hwy is 24 and cty is 20, then hwy_city is “24 highway; 20 city.”)
9Code. SELECT year, make, model, CONCAT(hwy, ' highway; ', cty, ' city') AS Highway_City
FROM vehicles;

10. Write a query that returns the id, make, model, and year for all records that have NULL for either the cyl or displ fields.
10Code. SELECT year, id, make, model, year
FROM vehicles
WHERE cyl IS NULL 
OR displ IS NULL;

11. Write a query that returns all fields for records with rear-wheel drive and diesel vehicles since 2000, inclusive. Also sort by year and highway mileage, both descending.
11Code. SELECT * 
FROM vehicles
WHERE year >= 2000
AND drive = 'Rear-Wheel Drive'
AND fuel = 'Diesel'
ORDER BY year, hwy DESC;

12. Write a query that counts the number of vehicles that are either Fords or Chevrolets and either compact cars or 2-seaters. Provide the query and the answer.
12A. 612
12Code. SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles
WHERE make IN('Ford', 'Chevrolet')
AND class IN('Two Seaters', 'Compact Cars');

13. Write a query that returns the records for 10 vehicles with the highest highway fuel mileage.
13Code. SELECT *
FROM vehicles
ORDER BY hwy DESC
LIMIT (10);

14. Write a query that returns all the records of vehicles since the year 2000 whose model name starts with a capital X. Sort the list A through Z by make. What happens when you use a lowercase “x” instead?
14A. When the lowercase 'x' replaces the capital 'X', different models are returned in the result.
14Code. SELECT *
FROM vehicles
WHERE year >= 2000
AND model LIKE 'X%'
ORDER BY model;

15. Write a query that returns the count of records where the “cyl” field is NULL. Provide the query as well as the answer.
15A. 58
15Code. SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles
WHERE cyl IS NULL;

16. Write a query that returns the count of all records before the year 2000 that got more than 20 mpg hwy and had greater than 3 liters displacement (“displ” field). Provide the query as well as the answer.
16A. 1964
16Code. SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles
WHERE year < 2000
AND hwy > 20
AND displ > 3;

17. Write a query that returns all records whose model name has a (capital) X in its 3rd position. Hint: make sure your wildcard operator accommodates for any characters after the “X”!
17Code. SELECT *
FROM vehicles
WHERE model LIKE '__X%';
