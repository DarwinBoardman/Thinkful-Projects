Module 15-1_Exploratory Data Analysis

1) What is the goal of EDA (exploratory data analysis)?
Answer: The goal of EDA is to clean and understand the data prior to modeling.

2) Suppose that you are given a dataset of customer product reviews for an e-commerce company. 
Each review is scored as a Likert-style survey item where 1 indicates a negative sentiment about the product 
and a 5 is positive. These reviews are collected on the company's website. a. What problems do you expect to
find in the raw data? b. If your task is to build features that give information about customer sentiments, 
how would you approach this task and what kind of methods would you apply to accomplish it? c. Try to identify 
some potentially useful features that you might derive from the raw data. How would you derive them and how 
would you assess the usefulness of those features?
Answer: 
A) Information might not be parsed cleanly, there could be outliers, columns might not be formatted correctly.
B) I would create a column for number of stars and another column for narratives from the customer feedback. 
Then, I would see if I could find overlapping words/phrases and cross reference them with the number of stars given.
C) Average stars/area and any demographics we could find. This could help us determine if product quality is 
better or worse in certain areas. The type and usefulness of the features would entirely be deteremined based on
the data collected.
