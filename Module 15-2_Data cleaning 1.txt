1. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of treating the Rank variable as categorical. Discuss your arguments with your mentor.
Rank as a categorical variable is a usefule way to evaluate other continuous variables based on similar grouping on value ranges. 
Ranges of continuous data, such as height, speed, or temperature can be assigned a ranking of 1, 2, or 3 and 
therefore groups of these data can be segmented and summarized as "like" and "dislike" data within the dataset.
They can then be analyzed based on the category of Rank. However, the data scientist or analysist should statistically determine what qualifies a 1, 2, or 3
assignment before blindly ranking the values.
