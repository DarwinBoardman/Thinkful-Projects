Thinkful Module 7-1: Getting Started

1. Networking mindset exercise: This is a self-reflective exercise that only requires you to
   think. When you think about connecting with others in your new tech field, what comes 
   to mind? Is this something that youâ€™re excited about? Are you anxious? Are you nervous? 
   Take about 5 - 10 minutes to assess your thoughts and feelings about networking.

Answer: The first thing that comes to mind when meeting new people in a new career field is that I'm the
outsider and it'll be tough to fit in. I've spent a lot of time branding myself as a geologist; so now that
I'm looking at data science, I'm concerned about culture shock on both sides. I'm definitely anxious and nervous.
However, I've networked for a long time and I think I can apply a lot of my skills in this effort. I just 
need to make sure that I don't come off as uneducated to the established data science community. 

2. entify 3 local networking opportunities you plan to attend and 3 tech professionals in your area you want to connect with.
