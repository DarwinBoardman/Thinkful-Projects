1.Write a query that returns a list of all the unique values in the 'country' field.
1Code. SELECT DISTINCT(country)
FROM ksprojects;

2. How many unique values are there for the main_category field? What about for the category field?
2A. tot_main_category = 15 and tot_category = 158
2Code. SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(main_category)) AS tot_main_category, COUNT(DISTINCT(category)) AS tot_category
FROM ksprojects;

3. Get a list of all the unique combinations of main_category and category fields, sorted A to Z by main_category.
3Code. SELECT DISTINCT main_category, category
FROM ksprojects
ORDER BY main_category;

4. How many unique categories are in each main_category?
4A. 
"Art"	13
"Comics"	6
"Crafts"	15
"Dance"	5
"Design"	7
"Fashion"	9
"Film & Video"	20
"Food"	13
"Games"	8
"Journalism"	6
"Music"	18
"Photography"	7
"Publishing"	15
"Technology"	16
"Theater"	7
4Code. SELECT main_category, COUNT(DISTINCT(category))
FROM ksprojects
GROUP BY main_category
ORDER BY main_category;

5. Write a query that returns the average number of backers per main_category, rounded to the nearest whole number and sorted from high to low.
5Code. SELECT ROUND(AVG(DISTINCT(backers), 0)) AS avg_backers, main_category
FROM ksprojects
GROUP BY main_category
ORDER BY avg_backers DESC;

6. Write a query that shows, for each category, how many campaigns were successful and the average difference per project between dollars pledged and the goal.
6Code. SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS tot_success, ROUND(AVG(usd_pledged - goal)) AS val_diff_per_proj
FROM ksprojects
WHERE state = 'successful'
GROUP BY category;
-- Assumption: Difference between dollar pledge and goal was requested but context was vague. 
-- I left the negative values in the results because the data would be more useful than returning 
-- absolute values of differences.

7. Write a query that shows, for each main category, how many projects had zero backers for that category and the largest goal amount for that category (also for projects with zero backers).
7Code. SELECT main_category, COUNT(*), CAST(MAX(goal) AS FLOAT)
FROM ksprojects
WHERE backers = 0
GROUP BY main_category
ORDER BY main_category;

8. For each category, find the average USD per backer, and return only those results for which the average USD per backer is < $50, sorted high to low. Hint: Division by NULL is not possible, so use NULLIF to replace NULLs with 0 in the average calculation.
8Code. SELECT DISTINCT(category), ROUND(AVG(usd_pledged/NULLIF(backers, 0))) AS avg_usd_per_backer
FROM ksprojects
GROUP BY category
HAVING ROUND(AVG(usd_pledged/NULLIF(backers, 0))) < 50
ORDER BY avg_usd_per_backer DESC;

9. Write a query that shows, for each main_category, how many successful projects had between 5 and 10 backers.
9Code. SELECT main_category, COUNT(*)
FROM ksprojects
WHERE state = 'successful' 
AND (backers BETWEEN 5 AND 10)
GROUP BY main_category;

10. Get a total of the amount ‘pledged’ for each type of currency grouped by its respective currency. Sort by ‘pledged’ from high to low.
10Code. SELECT DISTINCT(currency), CAST(SUM(pledged) AS FLOAT) AS sum_pledged 
FROM ksprojects
GROUP BY currency
ORDER BY sum_pledged DESC;
--()CAST(SUM(pledged) AS FLOAT) WAS NEEDED TO CONVERT 
-- FROM EXPONENTIAL NUMBERS TO FLOATS AND MAKE SENSE

11. Excluding Games and Technology records in the main_category field, return the total of all backers for successful projects by main_category where the total was more than 100,000. Sort by main_category from A to Z.
11Code. SELECT DISTINCT(main_category), SUM(backers) AS sum_backers
FROM ksprojects
WHERE main_category NOT IN('Games', 'Technology')
AND state = 'successful'
GROUP BY main_category
HAVING SUM(backers) > 100000
ORDER BY main_category;
