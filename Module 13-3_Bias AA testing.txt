Module 13-3 Bias and A/A testing

For each of the following scenarios, call out the potential biases in the proposed experiment. Do your best to try to discover not only the bias, but the initial design. 
There is plenty of room for interpretation here, so make sure to state what assumptions you're making.


1) You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
This initial design could have been trying to determine whether a version of the email will have more attention than another.
The contextual bias, in this case, was based around time of the year. Bathing suits are seasonal and the test should
have been ran during 1 season or another to determine effectiveness.

2) You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
This initial design was potentially trying to look at how many people have anxiety in a given population.
The sampling bias (or bias in assignment to conditions), in this case, was the concentration of people seeking out treatment for anxiety vs the general population and reports.

3) You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
This initial design was trying to gain website visits by trying new tactics, such as billboard advertisement.
The sampling bias, in this case, could be timing of the billboard. This could have been during a holiday or the advertisement 
could have been focused on another feature that was more relevant than in other times, like elections.  

4) You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
The initial design could have been trying to increase customer engagement or increase revenue through new business by launching new benefits.
Loyalty programs don't always take off quickly and might need more time for study. There could be no changes in visiting volume but there 
was no mention of whether there were repeat customers or new customers in that observation. There could be underlying success that was not
captured. Alternatively, if this loyalty program was launched during spring break, then hardly anyone will be around to see it.
