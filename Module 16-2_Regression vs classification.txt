Module 16-2_Regression vs Classification

For each of the following situations, decide if you would model using a regression or classification model.
Discuss your reasoning with your mentor next time you meet.

1. The amount a person will spend on a given site in the next 24 months. 
1A. Regression because the measure is a continuous variable of money people will spend on a categorical variable(website).

2. What color car someone is going to buy.
2A. Classification because it's based on the color scheme categories.

3. How many children a family will have.
3A. This one was tricky because families don't usually have an infinite number of kids. However, this could be
argued that some categorical and continuous information would be inputs for a continuous variable of amount of kids.
Therefore, this would be a regression model.

4. If someone will sign up for a service.
4A. Classification on yes or no.

5. The number of times someone will get sick in a year.
5A. Regression model would work in this case due to the fact that this isn't discussion what they will get sick with,
and foucused on frequency of sickness.

6. The probability someone will get sick in the next month.
6A. Regression because again, this isn't classifying what type of sickness they'll come down with.

7. Which medicine will work best for a given patient.
7A. Classification because it's basing the analysis on the categorical variable of medicine.
