Module 13-6_ Research Proposal

Look back to the potential experiments in the previous assignment. For one of those experiments, write up the essential points of a research proposal for an improved version of that experiment.

The problem:

The empire needs more troops to crush the rebellion. Darth Vadar and Emporer Palpatine have different preferred
slogans to test out in order to increase the rate of recruitment to their side. The focus is to convert as many people
as possible. The current slogan is "Give in to Your Anger" and doesn't seem to be very effective. Darth Vadar is proposing
a new slogan of "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy". 

The hypothesis:

The new slogan, "Give in to Your Anger" will improve recruiting results.

The method of testing:

50 men and 50 women of the ages 18-25 were taken from 10 planets, with a total of 1,000 prime candidates to join the empire.
A random sample of 500 men and women were selected to be shown the old slogan and the other half were shown the new slogan in 
separate rooms.

Both rooms were given their respective slogans by the same eager General. 

We will record the number of people who are willing to join the empire based on the slogans. If the new slogan proves to significanlty
generate more interest, then the empire will role out the new slogan across the galaxy.

Regardless...those who don't join us willingly will either be forced to join us or perish... because, we're the empire and that's
how we role. It'll be nice to know who we can convert easier, of course.

Other features to record will include planet of origin and whether they have ties to the empire and/or the rebellion.
